# Chamanara et al. (2023) Analysis
This repository holds iPython and python files that generate all plots found in the Bitcoin Policy Institute report on the Chamanara et al. study. It also includes code that calculates energy consumption for each country included in the study.

NOTE: You will need to update the directory locations for the csv files.

NOTE: The repo is itentionally  missing a file called, "Geographic Distribution 2020-2021 All Countries Breakdown.csv" because CBECI has not given me permission to make these data publicly available.
